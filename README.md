# Huss-ReadMe-Generator

For this week's assignment I created a command line application to generate an easy and professional README file. I utilized Node Modules (NPM), Inquirer and package.json. 

## Actions taken:
* Used Inquirer package to give the user with a series of questions via the command-line interface to answer to generator the readme.
* The user was provided with "list" prompt to allow them to select a license. 
* The "writefile" function was used to write the inputs onto the README. 
* The "init" function was used to initilize the application. 
* The licenseLink function was used so that the license selected will display as a badge on the read me (In the vidoe I did not include license but redid it with the MIT license). 
* The generate markdown function was used to display the inputted information in an organized and professional manner.
